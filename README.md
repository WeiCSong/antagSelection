# antagSelection
antagonistic effect of gene expression on polygenic disease might diminish the purifying selection that remove the risk eqtl.
This project contains three main steps: using SMR to find genes whose expression is related to disease and trait; using FOCUS to finemap the causal gene for disease and trait; 
using MESC to quantify the contribution of antagonistic genes to the disease risk.
Additional metrices like ASMC, SDS, CMS, GRoSS are used to quantify the selection pressure on antagonistic and non-antagonistic genes.
Ancient human genomes are used to quantify the gene expression changes in the history.
